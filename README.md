# DtProtobufToJson

## Installation
In order to install the application, please download the latest version of the package (currently located [here](https://github.com/EllanVanninCA/DtProtobufToJson/blob/master/dist/universal/dtprotobuftojson.zip)).

This package is a ZIP file that you can extract. Once extracted, there should be a subfolder called `bin` that contains various scripts to launch the app. Just make sure the appropriate script is executable and launch it.

PS: By default, the application listens on port 9000. You can change it by using the `http.port` system variable. For more information, you can go to [the official documentation page](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.4.x/ProductionConfiguration#specifying-the-http-server-address-and-port-using-system-properties).
